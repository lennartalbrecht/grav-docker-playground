# Grav - Docker Quick Start

I wanted to test **GravCMS** and wrote this little Docker setup so you can easily try it without overthinking. This setup is intended for **testing and getting to know Grav**, not necessarily for developing production-ready pages. If thereâ€™s interest, I can create a more robust setup tailored for development in the future.

## Quick Start Guide

1. Download these two files.
2. Open your folder.
3. Start the Docker engine.
4. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
5. Open [localhost](http://locahost) in your browser
6. Checkout the [Grav Documentation](https://learn.getgrav.org/17) and start exploring
